        [Elphaba:]
        I'm limited
        Just look at me
        Not with your eyes, with theirs
        I'm limited, and just look at you
        You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
        Here, take it
        [Glinda:]
        What? But you know I, I can't read this, I
        [Elphaba:]
        Well, you have to learn
        Because now it's up to you
        For both of us
        Now it's up to you
        [Glinda:]
        I've heard it said
        That people come into our lives for a reason
        Bringing something we must learn
        And we are led
        To those who help us most to grow
        If we let them
        And we help them in return
        Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
        But I know I'm who I am today
        Because I knew you
        Like a comet pulled from orbit
        As it passes a sun
        Like a stream that meets a boulder
        Halfway through the wood
        Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But
        Because I knew you
        I have been changed for good
        [Elphaba:]
        It well may be
        That we will never meet again
        In this lifetime
        So let me say before we part
        So much of me
        Is made of what I learned from you
        You'll be with me
        Like a handprint on my heart
        And now whatever way our stories end
        I know you have re-written mine
        By being my friend
        Like a ship blown from its mooring
        By a wind off the sea
        Like a seed dropped by a skybird
        In a distant wood
        Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But
        Because I knew you
        [Glinda:]
        Because I knew you
        [Glinda & Elphaba:]
        I have been changed for good
        [Elphaba:]
        And just to clear the air
        I ask forgiveness
        For the things I've done you blame me for
        [Glinda:]
        But then, I guess we know there's blame to share
        [Glinda & Elphaba:]
        And none of it seems to matter anymore
        [Glinda (Elphaba):]
        Like a comet pulled from orbit

        Just look at me
        Not with your eyes, with theirs
        I'm limited, and just look at you
        You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
        Here, take it
        [Glinda:]
        What? But you know I, I can't read this, I
        [Elphaba:]
        Well, you have to learn
        Because now it's up to you
        For both of us
        Now it's up to you
        [Glinda:]
        I've heard it said
        That people come into our lives for a reason
        Bringing something we must learn
        And we are led
        To those who help us most to grow
        If we let them
        And we help them in return
        Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
        But I know I'm who I am today
        Because I knew you
        Like a comet pulled from orbit
        As it passes a sun
        Like a stream that meets a boulder
        Halfway through the wood
        Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But
        Because I knew you
        I have been changed for good
        [Elphaba:]
        It well may be
        That we will never meet again
        In this lifetime
        So let me say before we part
        So much of me
        Is made of what I learned from you
        You'll be with me
        Like a handprint on my heart
        And now whatever way our stories end
        I know you have re-written mine
        By being my friend
        Like a ship blown from its mooring
        By a wind off the sea
        Like a seed dropped by a skybird
        In a distant wood
        Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But
        Because I knew you
        [Glinda:]
        Because I knew you
        [Glinda & Elphaba:]
        I have been changed for good
        [Elphaba:]
        And just to clear the air
        I ask forgiveness
        For the things I've done you blame me for
        [Glinda:]
        But then, I guess we know there's blame to share
        [Glinda & Elphaba:]
        And none of it seems to matter anymore
        [Glinda (Elphaba):]
        Like a comet pulled from orbit
        (Like a ship blown from its mooring)
        As it passes a sun
        (By a wind off the sea)
        Like a stream that meets a boulder
        (Like a seed dropped by a bird in the wood)
        Halfway through the wood
        (In the wood)
        Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
        I do believe I have been changed for the better
        [Glinda:]
